How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Like hell.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you more efficient programmer in the long term?
I cannot even imagine all the possibilities.
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google does?
